-> A fully-developed turbulent channel flow is solved numerically using Launder, Reece and Rodi (LRR) Reynolds Stress Model using wall-modelled approach.   
-> The governing equations for turbulent quantities has changed as now there will be additional equations for Reynolds stresses.  
-> The details of the discretization of all equations using FVM is given in the report file.  
-> Please note that the initialization of velocity field and reynolds stress turbulent quantities was mapped from $k-\varepsilon$ model.  
-> So kindly keep the k_epsilon.m and lrr_rsm.m files in the same directory.
