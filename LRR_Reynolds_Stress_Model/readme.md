-> A fully-developed turbulent channel flow is solved numerically using Launder, Reece and Rodi (LRR) Reynolds Stress Model with suitable wall functions.  
-> The details of the discretization of all equations using FVM is given in the report file.  
-> Please note that the initialization of velocity field and reynolds stress turbulent quantities was mapped from $k-\varepsilon$ model.
