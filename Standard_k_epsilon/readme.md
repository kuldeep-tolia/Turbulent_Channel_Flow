-> To solve for fully-developed turbulent channel flow using LRR Reynolds Stress Model, it was initialized using standard $k-\varepsilon$ model with wall functions.  
-> This is performed to ensure the stability of LRR Reynolds Stress Model otherwise it may diverge with random initialization.   
-> Thus the data generated by the $k-\varepsilon$ model is mapped to the domain as the initial values for the LRR Reynolds Stress Model.
